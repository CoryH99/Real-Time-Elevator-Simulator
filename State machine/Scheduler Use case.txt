Use case for Scheduler : Handle Floor and Elevator events

Pre-condition: Floor subsystem has received a new FloorEvent
               
Post-condition: Floor subsystem has received the signal from the 
elevator
	
Primary Actor: Scheduler subsystem
Secondary Actor: Floor subsystem & Elevator subsystem
	
Basic Flow:
1- A floor event is sent to scheduler after update detected in EventFile
2- Scheduler waits for floor event
3- After receiving floor event scheduler and adds it to a floor event queue
4- The next floor event in line is then forwarded to the elevator 
subsystem
5- The scheduler subsystem waits for a return signal from the elevator
subsystem
6- After receiving the signal, the scheduler forward the return signal
to the floor subsystem

Extension
Step 2: 
A- Floor event is get losts and is not received by scheduler
   1- The scheduler wait for next floor event to be sent
Step 4 & 6:
A- Scheduler is not able to send event/signal
   1- The scheduler is put on pause and returns to initial state
Step 5:
A- The return signal gets lost and is not received by the scheduler
   1- The scheduler is put on pause and returns to initial state
