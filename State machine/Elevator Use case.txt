Use case for Elevator : Handles events and move

Pre-condition: Scheduler sends floor event from floor subsystem
               
Post-condition: Scheduler receives return signal from elevator

Primary Actor: Elevator subsystem
Secondary Actor: Floor subsystem & Scheduler subsystem
	
Basic Flow:
1- Elevator waits for floor event to be received from scheduler
2- After event is received, elevator closes door.
3- Elevator starts moving up/down depending on target floor
4- After reaching destination, elevator stops and door is openned
5- Elevator send return signal back to scheduler

Extension
Step 2: 
A- Elevator never receives floor event from scheduler
   1- Elevator waits for next floor event
B- Someone blocks the door from closing
   1- Elevator returns to step 2
Step 3: 
A- New target floor is received
   1- Elevator goes to closer target floor and door opens
   2- Door is closed and elevator goes to next target destination
